This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts developed to evaluate and compare net primary production (NPP) models against *in situ* data. The scripts process, format and visualise freely-available NPP products for the global ocean and compare them with *in situ* oceanographic data from time-series stations using the <sup>14</sup>C technique, enabling the identification of the most optimal model based on this comparison. The workflow addresses the often-overlooked task of systematically assessing multiple existing biogeochemical forcing products for ocean models.

The analysed NPP datasets include: 
- Carbon, Absorption, and Fluorescence Euphotic-resolving ([**CAFE**](http://orca.science.oregonstate.edu/1080.by.2160.monthly.hdf.cafe.m.php)) model
- Carbon-based Production Model ([**CbPM**](http://orca.science.oregonstate.edu/1080.by.2160.monthly.hdf.cbpm2.m.php))
- Vertically Generalized Production Model ([**VGPM**](http://orca.science.oregonstate.edu/1080.by.2160.monthly.hdf.vgpm.m.chl.m.sst.php))
- **Carr ([2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0967-0645(01)00094-7)) model**
- ESA Biological Pump and Carbon Exchange Processes ([**BICEP**](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/69b2c9c6c4714517ba10dab3515e4ee6/)) project model

## Requirements

To use the content of this repository, ensure you have the following.
- [MATLAB](https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version R2021a or later installed.
- Third-party functions downloaded from [MATLAB'S File Exchange](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/): `brewermap` and `subaxis`. Once downloaded, please place the functions under the `./resources/external/` directory.

## Repository Structure

 - `./code/`: contains the MATLAB scripts for analysing and visualising data (*provided, see "MATLAB Scripts" section*).
 - `./data/`
    - `./raw/`: raw NPP data, comprising models and *in situ* observations (*partly provided, see "Obtaining Raw Data" section*).
    - `./processed/`: output data generated by the MATLAB scripts (*partly provided, unless size limits restrictions*).
- `./resources/`
    - `./external/`: third-party resources for plotting and functions (*see "Requirements" section*).
    - `./internal/`: custom MATLAB functions generated specifically for calculating and plotting (*provided*).
- `./figures/`: figures generated from processed data (*provided*).

## Obtaining Raw Data

Raw NPP model data were obtained as `.nc` files from the repositories corresponding to the five models listed above. These files were then processed using scripts in in this related [repository](https://github.com/annarufas/ocean-data-lab) (not included here due to size constraints), resulting in the generation of the following five `.mat` files: `npp_cafe_modis.mat`, `npp_cbpm_modis.mat`, `npp_vgpm_modis.mat`, `npp_carr2002_seawifs_pathfinder.mat`, `npp_bicep.mat`. Once generated, please place them under the `./data/raw/` directory.

## Reproducibility

The provided scripts perform a matchup analysis using *in situ* data from the following study sites:
- Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) station ALOHA, in the subtropical NE Pacific (22.45ºN, 158ºW).
- Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series (BATS) study site, in the subtropical NW Atlantic (31.6ºN, 64.2ºW).
- US JGOFS Equatorial Pacific process study experimental site (EqPac), in the central equatorial Pacific upwelling system (–2 to 2ºN, 140ºW).
- Ocean Station Papa (OSP), in the HNLC region of the subpolar NE Pacific (50ºN, 145ºW).
